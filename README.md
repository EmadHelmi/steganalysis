# Steganalysis in python with deep learning algorithms
This is my university master project.

This project consists of two major parts:
+ Steganography
+ Steganalysis
## Steganography
In this part I have downloaded matlab codes from [Jessica Fridrich website](http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/) (you can also get the algorithms from [here](http://dde.binghamton.edu/download/stego_algorithms/)).

For embedding process I used these datasets:
+ BSDS300 ([Download link](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/BSDS300-images.tgz))
+ BSDS500 ([Download link](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/BSR/BSR_bsds500.tgz))
+ INRIA-jpg1 ([Download link](ftp://ftp.inrialpes.fr/pub/lear/douze/data/jpg1.tar.gz))
+ INRIA-jpg2 ([Download link](ftp://ftp.inrialpes.fr/pub/lear/douze/data/jpg2.tar.gz))

with **0.05**, **0.1**, **0.2** and **0.4** payloads. I also used the **J-UNIWARD** algorithm with matlab code ([download](http://dde.binghamton.edu/download/stego_algorithms/download/J-UNIWARD_matlab_v11.zip])) and I have changed it. I put all codes in the **graphy** folder.
